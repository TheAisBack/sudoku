# Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree
## Introductory Project: Diagonal Sudoku Solver

# Question 1 (Naked Twins)
Q: How do we use constraint propagation to solve the naked twins problem?  
A: Constraint propagation is used in the Naked Twins Strategy by looking for 2 numbers in a box that are the same two numbers in a box, which are located in a column or a row. The other boxes in these areas that have the same 2 numbers will then then be removed and the 2 numbers will be put into either or of the 2 boxes found or switched depending on if a solution is found. 

# Question 2 (Diagonal Sudoku)
Q: How do we use constraint propagation to solve the diagonal Sudoku problem?  
A: Constraint propagation is used in the Diagonal Strategy by adding the diagonal units in the unitslist, which will, therefore, be the constraints of the Sudoku. Then using the elimination, search and other functions used in the solution python, we will then find the solution for the Sudoku. 

### Install

This project requires **Python 3**.

We recommend students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 
Please try using the environment we provided in the Anaconda lesson of the Nanodegree.

##### Optional: Pygame

Optionally, you can also install pygame if you want to see your visualization. If you've followed our instructions for setting up our conda environment, you should be all set.

If not, please see how to download pygame [here](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml).

### Code

* `solution.py` - You'll fill this in as part of your solution.
* `test_solution.py` - Do not modify this. You can test your solution by running `python -m unittest`.
* `PySudoku.py` - Do not modify this. This is code for visualizing your solution.
* `visualize.py` - Do not modify this. This is code for visualizing your solution.

### Visualizing

To visualize your solution, please only assign values to the values_dict using the `assign_value` function provided in solution.py

### Submission
Before submitting your solution to a reviewer, you are required to submit your project to Udacity's Project Assistant, which will provide some initial feedback.  

The setup is simple.  If you have not installed the client tool already, then you may do so with the command `pip install udacity-pa`.  

To submit your code to the project assistant, run `udacity submit` from within the top-level directory of this project.  You will be prompted for a username and password.  If you login using google or facebook, visit [this link](https://project-assistant.udacity.com/auth_tokens/jwt_login) for alternate login instructions.

This process will create a zipfile in your top-level directory named sudoku-<id>.zip.  This is the file that you should submit to the Udacity reviews system.
